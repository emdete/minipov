# Linear Animations

You can use the device for just linear LED animations as well. This is not only
nice for testing.

These are the functions:

- `ani_all.c` switch all LEDs on
- `ani_alt.c` alternate the LEDs
- `ani_ledtest.c` a moving light

## Animating with sensor

- `ani_sensor_test.c` animate LEDs on sensor switch
- `ani_sensor_pong.c` animate LEDs on sensor switch back & forth
